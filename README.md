# Dexter (API)

An "[Overlord API](https://github.com/EasterCompany/Overlord-API)" which receives inputs from interfaces and translates them into consumables formats for a "[Dexter](https://github.com/EasterCompany/Dexter)" to consume.
Each dexter api deployment is the centralising point in a network of nodes and user interfaces.

One instance you may want to deploy your own API is for an off-grid home network, however we really recommend utilizing the over-whelming benefits of the fully encrypted & anonymized per-to-per decentralized DexNode network.
It couldn't be any safer or more rewarding or more convienient.
